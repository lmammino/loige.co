With very practical examples we'll learn how streams work in Node.js & the Browser. With streams, you will be able to write elegant JavaScript applications that are much more composable and memory efficient!

Streams are probably one of the most beautiful features of Node.js, but still largely underestimated and rarely used. Once you'll grasp the fundamentals, you'll be able to solve some ordinary programming challenges in a much more elegant and efficient way. With streams power in your tool belt, you'll be able to write applications that can deal with gigabytes or even terabytes of data efficiently.

This talk will cover the following topics: Streams: when and how; Different types of streams; Built-in and custom streams; Composability; Utils & Streams in the browser.
