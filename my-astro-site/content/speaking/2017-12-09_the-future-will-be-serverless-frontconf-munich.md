Software development is on the verge of a new revolution that will change the rules of the Cloud Computing game... again!

The new wind of change is called "Serverless" and you should definitely get ready for it!

In this talk I will illustrate why I believe Serverless will be a game changer in the industry, how did we get to have Serverless and how to get started with it to build real products.
