If you want to run this locally (maybe you found a typo or an error in one of my articles and want to fix it), you can follow these instructions:

## 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmammino/loige.co.git
```

## 2. Make sure you have up-to-date versions of Node.js and pnpm

Expected Node.js version: `20` or higher and `pnpm` version `8` or higher.

```bash
node -v
pnpm -v
```

If you have `corepack` installed, you can easily enable `pnpm` with:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@8 --activate
```

Alternatively, check out the [pnpm official installation instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation).

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 4. Run the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The website should now be accessible at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

## 5. Build the static website

```bash
pnpm build
```

The static website will be available in the `./dist` folder.

## 6. Deploy the website

The website is deployed through [GitHub Actions](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml), so if you want to suggest some updates, open a PR and I will review it as soon as possible. Once merged into `main`, a deployment will kick in automatically.
