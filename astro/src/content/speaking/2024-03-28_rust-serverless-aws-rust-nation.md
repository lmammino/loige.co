Rust is taking the software engineering world by storm, but how does it affect serverless? In AWS it's not even a supported runtime, so how can we even use it... and should we even try to do that? Spoiler: yes we should and it's actually quite easy to get started with it!

If you ever wondered why you should consider Rust for your serverless functions here are a few points:

- Performance
- Safety
- Cost
- Developer Experience

In this talk, we will explore what is Rust, why you should consider writing your Lambda functions in this language, and how to get started writing your first lambda. I will provide several practical code examples making this talk an effective walk-through tutorial.
