In 2020 I started to be a bit more serious about learning Rust. After having read a few books and having done some coding challenges, I decided to start live-streaming my attempts to solve Advent of Code challenges using Rust. Fast forward to 2022 I completed 50 challenges and learned a lot about how to use Rust to solve specific programming challenges. In this talk, I’ll be sharing some common tips and tricks that I discovered while live-coding also thanks to the beautiful Rust community that gave me tons of suggestions! Some topics I’ll be covering in this talk: parsing input, data structures, error handling, iterators, performance, allocating and manipulating 2d matrices, etc.
