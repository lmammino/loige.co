You finally built that amazing start-up idea you had in mind for years and you did it using Node.js! That's Great! You just launched it on Hacker News and you are very happy and proud... but now more and more people are using it and you start to have a nasty fear that Node.js won't scale because you now... it's single-threaded! Is your project doomed now? Do you have to invest your time on rewriting it in something like C++ or maybe Rust or even Go? You'd rather invest your time on adding valuable features for your users rather than learning a new language and rewriting everything from scratch, but what if nothing works anymore? And... by the way, what the heck "single-threaded" really means?! Fear no more, dear fellow developer! In this talk, we will discuss the architecture of Node.js going through its strengths and its weaknesses. We will then talk about scalability and I will share some valuable tips and tricks to make your Node.js app scale! Spoiler alert: you probably won't need Go or Rust :)
