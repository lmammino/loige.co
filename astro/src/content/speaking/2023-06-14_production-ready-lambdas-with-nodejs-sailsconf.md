A few tips that i learned along the way on how to build production-grade lambdas using AWS: testing, logging, metrics, tracing, infrastructure as code, code-reuse, frameworks and more! Writing Lambdas is quite easy, at the end of the day it is just a function, right?! But writing GOOD production-grade lambdas, well that is an entirely other story. In this talk, I will share some of the tips and tricks that I learned building Lambda functions in Node.js during the last 6 years. We will talk about code organisation and code reuse, testing, logging, metrics, tracing, infrastructure as code and more.
