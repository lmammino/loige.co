During the course of this workshop, we will deep dive on the serverless paradigm, analysing the most important features and qualities and finally how the design of a serverless application differs from a traditional one. After this introduction, we will move quickly into practical exercises that will allow us to build, step by step, a complete serverless application on top of AWS services such as Lambda Functions, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, Dynamo DB and CloudFormation.
