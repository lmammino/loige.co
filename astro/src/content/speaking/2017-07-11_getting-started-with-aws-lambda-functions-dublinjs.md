Serverless is becoming the cool new kid on the block taking software development by storm. Enterprises and developers alike are embracing the new paradigm in order to drive innovation, time to marked and solve complex architectural challenges.

Join Padraig and Luciano in this workshop as we take you through a discovery path and show you how to embrace the serverless architecture in your projects.

We want to help you understand what serverless really is and why you should use it to power up your next ambitious application on AWS using Lambda Functions.

The workshop will involve a fair amount of code that you’ll need to implement to solve different real-world problems and thus at the end you should be familiar and comfortable with the serverless concepts.

### Topics

- Exploring the Serverless paradigm
- What are the typical use cases and the cloud providers you can use
- Taking AWS Lambda Functions for a spin with some entertaining examples
- Closing up with an advanced example showcased by the mentors

### Pre-requisites

- Your own machine
- An existing subscription on AWS
- Familiarity with JavaScript/Node.js (nice to have)
