Since we started seeing JS on the server side, the developers' dream has been to reduce the gap and the cost of switch between frontend and backend.

Today with Node.js, React, and a whole ecosystem of tools, this dream is becoming true!

In this workshop, Luciano is going to discuss Universal (a.k.a. Isomorphic) JS and present some practical examples regarding the major patterns related to routing, data retrieval, and rendering.

He will use Node.js, React, Webpack, Babel, and React Router, and give you a series of examples to get you started easily with this new technology trend.
