description: This blog post explains how to build a distributed application
  using Node.js and ZeroMQ that cracks JWT tokens. It provides a step-by-step
  guide on implementing the application and links to two in-depth articles on
  RisingStack that cover the theory and coding details.

In the last 2 weeks I add the pleasure to release an article (in two parts) in collaboration with [RisingStack](http://risingstack.com/), one of the most famous companies in the [Node.js](/tag/node-js) ecosystem.

The article explains how to build a distributed application using Node.js and [ZeroMQ](/tag/zeromq) and provides an example that I believe it's very actual and interesting: a [JWT](/tag/jwt) token cracker.

If you are into Node.js, ZeroMQ, security or distributed application you can read the two articles in the community section of RisingStack.

[![ZeroMQ & Node.js Tutorial - Cracking JWT Tokens](./zeromq-nodejs-tutorial-cracking-jwt-tokens.jpg)](https://community.risingstack.com/zeromq-node-js-cracking-jwt-tokens-1/)

**[ZeroMQ & Node.js Tutorial - Cracking JWT Tokens (Part 1.)](https://community.risingstack.com/zeromq-node-js-cracking-jwt-tokens-1/)**, is focused mostly on theory and describes what a JWT token is and what will be our approach to try to crack one of them.

**[ZeroMQ & Node.js Tutorial - Cracking JWT Tokens (Part 2.)](https://community.risingstack.com/zeromq-node-js-cracking-jwt-tokens-part2/)**, instead, focuses on coding and it's a step by step guide on how to build the working application.

The application is also freely available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/distributed-jwt-cracker) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lmammino/distributed-jwt-cracker) in case you want to simply download it or contribute.
