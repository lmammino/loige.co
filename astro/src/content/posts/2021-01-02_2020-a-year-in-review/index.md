As we transition into 2021 and we leave this crazy 2020 behind, it is a great time for me to reflect on my what happened in 2020 from a career perspective and make some plans for the year to come.

Usual **spoiler alert**: this is the fifth year in a row for me writing this kind of post. This is going to be a super boring one that I write for myself to reflect on where my career is going and what I am learning every year.

I hope I am setting the right expectation here. If you decide to go ahead and read this, get comfortable and grab a coffee because it's going to get quite *BOOORING*.

Yeah, this is a boring GIF. A silly attempt to warn you and (hopefully) to make things slightly less boring! ðŸ˜œ


## An important reflection

Before getting started, I want to make a small but important reflection about this crazy 2020, signed by a worldwide pandemic and a global crisis. And, by the way, I dare to remind you that none of this will be magically over just because we are in a new year now... ðŸ˜Ÿ

This is something that no one could have predicted and it should rightfully shift our perspective towards society and ourself as individuals.

Of course, I am not going to tell you how you should reconsider your life, but I want to share how I am reconsidering some small elements in mine.

In the last few years, I have been quite eager to grow as a professional and I tried to accomplish more and more every year, sometimes at the expense of time spent with the people that are dear to me. In retrospective, I recognize that sometimes I might have been a bit too selfish, and I should try hard to change that...

I have been quite lucky in 2020 because even in these strange times, I have been one of the privileged ones. I work in an industry that it is still thriving (now more than ever) and I didn't lose my job, nor did I have to take a pay cut. I somehow managed to stay healthy throughout last year and so did most of the people dear to me.

I hope that most of the people reading this could say the same, but we all can't ignore the fact that the majority of people out there are struggling and suffering.

I don't think, as an individual, that I can have any significant impact to make things better on a large scale, but I can have an impact on my local community and with the people I care about.

I am not planning anything big here. I want to try to be more aware and careful with the people around. A phone call or just asking _"how are you today?"_, _"what are you doing?"_, _"I was thinking about you..."_ or _"can I help you with anything?"_ could be small gestures but they might mean a lot for the people you care about, even at distance.

I have tried to do these things a little bit this year, but I'll try to it more next year. I want to encourage you to do the same.

In short, I am wishing for 2021 that we can be more compassionate and support each other more.

## Node.js Design Patterns - Third edition

[Mario Casciaro](https://twitter.com/mariocasciaro) and I have been working on the third edition of [Node.js Desing Patterns (the book)](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/) since September 2019. This new edition finally came out this year at the end of July 2020.

[![Node.js Design Patterns book on a table next to a plant](./nodejs-design-patterns-book-on-a-table-next-to-a-plant.jpg)](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/)

We have been spending countless hours working in tandem on this new edition, which resulted in a full rewrite of the previous edition and a lot of additional new content. The print edition turned out to be massive counting more than 660 pages!

A lot has changed in the Node.js landscape since 2016 (when we published the second edition) and in this book, we tried to take full advantage of new interesting capabilities like `async/await` and `ESM`. We have also grown a lot as engineers in the last 4 years and this helped us to put things on a different perspective and improve the overall quality of the book compared to the previous editions.

We re-imagined the book as a learning path and we decided to add exercises at the end of every chapter. This allows readers to test their understanding of the main concepts. In this perspective, we also created a [wiki](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Node.js-Design-Patterns-Third-Edition/wiki/Node.js-Design-Patterns-Third-Edition
