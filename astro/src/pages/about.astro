            I am a <strong>passionate software engineer</strong> born in 1987, the
            same year that ‚ÄúSuper Mario Bros‚Äù was released in Europe, which, by chance
            is my favourite game!
          </p>

          <p>
            I started coding early at the age of 12, hacking away with my
            father's old i386 armed only with MS-DOS and the QBasic interpreter
            and I have been professionally a software developer for more than 15
            years.

            Yep, I am a <strong>Full stack web developer</strong> working on cloud
            products. I enjoy coding (a lot) even though, lately, I am spending more
            and more time working on systems and <strong
              >cloud architectures</strong
            >. AWS has recognized my efforts in this area and I am now an <a
              href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/luciano-mammino/"
              >AWS Hero</a

          <p>
            I <strike>am</strike> was an entrepreneur: during the first part of my
            career, I co-founded several companies, a couple of web and software
            agencies and even a startup, <a href="https://sbaam.com/"
              >Sbaam.com</a
            >, that aimed to disrupt the emerging fashion brands industry. I
            can't say any of these businesses was successful, but I definitely
            learned a lot and I believe I still preserve some of that
            entrepreneurial mindset.

            I am a fighter, I enjoy practicing martial arts as a hobby and as a
            way to stay healthy both phisically and mentally. I have a red belt
            (master) in <em>Sicilian Stick Fighting</em> (yep, <a
              href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Bastone+Siciliano"
              rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank">such thing really exists</a
            >), black belt in <em>Judo</em> and purple belt in <em
              >Brasilian Jiu-Jitsu</em
            > (I still suck at martial arts, but it's fun and it keeps me reasonably
            fit).

            For what concerns the <em>butterfly making</em> part, well... you will
            have to ask me in person! :)

            I love to write technical articles to share my knowledge and, most
