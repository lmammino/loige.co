meta_description: An opinionated take on what's the role and the skills that are expected from a "senior" developer
tags: ['life', 'career']
---

In today's fast-paced tech industry, the role of a senior software engineer has become increasingly important and something many engineers strive to be recognized as. But **are you senior yet**? And **what's expected from a senior**?

The truth is that answering these questions is a very subjective manner and different people or different companies might give very different answers.

In this article, I'll try to give you my take, based on my opinions and personal experience. So let's get to it!

> This article is based on a presentation I gave last year called [The senior dev, an opinionated take](https://loige.link/senior).

Hopefully, this article can inspire engineers and help managers to hire, set expectations, and support their teams.


## Senior? Yes, but how much? ðŸ¤Œ

The first remark I have to make is that I am not going to focus on different levels of seniority like what it means to be a _Staff_ or a _Principal_ engineer.

What I want to focus on is what it takes to be considered and valued as a _Senior_ in the most general sense.

So what it means to be a _Senior in the most general sense_?

The core responsibilities of a senior engineer are to **move projects and people forward**.

Some people like to call that "_being **a force multiplier**_", which, be aware, is very different from being a _10x engineer_. In fact, a senior engineer is first of all a **team player** and not a lone hero (or a rockstar, superstar, magician, grey-bearded wizard, or unicorn)!

Easier said than done! What kind of skills, mindset, and duties are we talking about? How can an engineer effectively help to move things forward (more than a junior or a mid-level engineer can do)?

## Am I a senior yet?

The first myth to bust is that being senior is not necessarily a matter of how long one has been in the market!

> More time â‰  more senior

Yes, it definitely helps to have been around for longer. The more you do something the higher the chances that you will have faced different challenges and learned something from them!

So, let's not say that you are a senior if you have _5+ years of experience_ or something like that.

Similarly, being senior is not a matter of age. Growing older doesn't necessarily make you better at your job... a senior is not someone with _at least 40 years of age_...

In my career, I had the fortune to truly appreciate this.

I had some very young but extremely passionate and skilled colleagues that I would definitely consider senior, and I also had _older_ colleagues with many years in the industry on their CV but their contribution to the team and the project was nearly close to zero, if not even negative!

## Skills

If it's not a matter of time in the industry, what is it then?

Remember, it's all about moving your project and your team forward... and this takes some skills, so what kind of skills are we talking about?!

When it comes to **technical skills**, a senior software engineer is expected to have a solid foundation in programming languages, frameworks, databases, architectures, etc. However, technical skills are not the only thing that sets a senior software engineer apart. **Soft skills**, such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving, are equally important.

I would even argue that **for a senior engineer, soft skills are even more important than technical skills**, because it's not just about what you know, but is about how you communicate that, how you influence other people to leverage your knowledge, how you share your expertise and make the team more self-sufficient and productive.

Communication skills are vital for senior software engineers, as they often work with cross-functional teams and communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. A senior engineer must be able to clearly articulate their ideas, listen actively, and provide constructive feedback.

Leadership skills are also essential for senior software engineers, as they are often responsible for mentoring junior team members, leading project teams, and making technical decisions. A senior engineer must be able to inspire and motivate their team, delegate tasks effectively, and provide guidance and support when needed.

Problem-solving skills are another critical skill set that senior software engineers must possess. They must be able to think critically, analyze complex problems, and find creative solutions. Senior engineers should be comfortable with ambiguity and be able to adapt quickly to changing requirements.

At the end of the day, software engineering is all about solving problems!

But in complex organisations, with many stakeholders coming from very different backgrounds, problems are not only technical. And problems can be badly defined and change often. So, being able to contribute to understanding what is the problem at hand, creating and sharing a vision, steering the team to take the right direction are all crucial skills that can have a massive impact.

The best _technical_ solution is not always the absolute best solution for an organisation.

The best solution is one that accounts for how easy it is for more junior people to contribute to it, how easy it will be to evolve it and adapt it to changing requirements, how well will it scale if the business is successful, etc. 

Sometimes you might have to compromise on purely technical qualities to come up with solutions that are optimal for the team and the business environment you are working on.

It takes a lot more than just technical skills to see all the facets of a project and be able to come up with solutions that can fulfill all the needs.

## Mindset

The mindset of a senior software engineer is just as crucial as their technical and soft skills.

A senior engineer must have a **growth mindset**, a willingness to learn and adapt, and a drive for continuous improvement.

They should be **comfortable with failure**, see it as an opportunity to learn, and **be willing to take risks**.

A senior engineer must also be a team player, not a hero. They should collaborate with their team, support their colleagues, and contribute to the team's success.

They should be humble, open to feedback, and willing to share their knowledge and expertise.

Duties
The duties of a senior software engineer are varied and can vary from company to company. However, some common responsibilities of a senior engineer include:

Leading and mentoring junior team members
Making technical decisions and providing technical guidance
Collaborating with cross-functional teams
Contributing to code reviews and ensuring code quality
Communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Identifying areas for improvement and proposing solutions
Conclusion
In conclusion, the role of a senior software engineer is crucial in today's tech industry. Senior engineers must possess technical and soft skills, a growth mindset, and a team-oriented mindset. They should be willing to take risks, learn from failure, and contribute to their team's success. As the definition of seniority varies from company to company, it's essential for managers to set clear expectations and support their senior engineers' growth and development.




Senior software engineers play a crucial role in moving projects and teams forward. They are not just skilled programmers, but they also possess a range of soft skills that are essential for success in their role. In this article, we'll explore what's expected from a senior software engineer, their skills, mindset, and duties.

## Skills

Technical skills are important, but they are not enough to be a successful senior software engineer. Senior engineers have a "T-shaped profile," which means they have mastered one area of expertise but are proficient in several other areas. For example, a senior engineer may be an expert in backend and API development but can also do some frontend and understand cloud architectures.

Besides technical skills, senior engineers must have a broad understanding of the platform, architecture, code structure, testing, deployment process, and scalability model. They should also understand tradeoffs, such as monolith vs. microservices, memory vs. CPU, and highly scalable vs. low latency, and optimize for the most relevant ones. Senior engineers should also be flexible, comfortable with different programming languages, and paradigms, and can solve problems in different ways and with different tools.

Bug catching is another critical skill for senior software engineers. They should understand and refine user stories, write different types of tests, and find and discuss edge cases. Additionally, senior engineers should keep track of technical debt and help to pay it back. They should be good advisors, understanding patterns and best practices, and suggest patterns that have good long-term effects while avoiding others that may lead to problems.

## Mindset and Duties

Senior software engineers are team players, not heroes, rockstars, superstars, magicians, or unicorns. They are active levers that ask hard questions, take leadership to find what they don't know, and bridge between product and technology. They know when (and how) to say NO and understand the business, its purpose, long-term vision, strategy, unique strengths, main weaknesses, and how technology can help.

Senior engineers must also be excellent communicators, able to talk with all stakeholders, explain uncertainties, propose ideas on how to address them, talk about failures and learnings, write docs and deliver presentations, and make complex topics digestible. They should support management, plan, drive ceremonies, keep track of priorities and technical debt, split complex tasks into manageable parts, and understand and leverage team strengths.

Autonomy is another important mindset for senior software engineers. They can drive projects that require research and grind, but are aware of avoiding silos. They know how to get unstuck, ask for help, research and experiment, read the docs, and read and understand existing code. Senior engineers focus on delivery, negotiate expectations, and have a positive attitude. They don't blame the system, propose solutions, facilitate conversations, help find compromises, and have confidence that hard problems can be solved, even if they don't know how yet.

## Growth and Fun

To grow, senior software engineers should go one level deeper and not stop at the layer they are familiar with. They should build prototypes to test their understanding and learn new things, even if they are not directly related to their work. Senior engineers should have fun and showcase what they learned to their peers, applying their learnings at work. They should also create content such as articles, talks, videos, Twitter threads, etc., and make it a habit. Creating content improves communication skills and helps them become better senior engineers.
