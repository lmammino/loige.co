meta_description: An opinionated take on what's the role and the skills that are expected from a "senior" developer
tags: ['life', 'career']
---

In today's fast-paced tech industry, the role of a senior software engineer has become increasingly important and something many engineers strive to be recognized as. But **are you senior yet**? And **what's expected from you a senior**?

The truth is that answering these questions is a very subjective matter and different people or different companies might give very different answers.

In this article, I'll try to give you my take, based on my opinions and personal experience.

So let's get to it!

> This article is based on a presentation I gave last year called [The senior dev, an opinionated take](https://loige.link/senior).

Hopefully, this article can inspire engineers to grow in their careers, help managers to hire the right people, set expectations, and support their teams.


## Senior? Yes, but how much? 🤌

The first remark I have to make is that I am not going to focus on different levels of seniority like what it means to be a _Staff_, a _Principal_ engineer or even an _Architect_.

What I want to focus on is what it takes to be considered and valued as a _Senior_ in the most general sense.

Ok Luciano, but what heck do you mean by _being senior in the most general sense_?

The core responsibilities of a senior engineer are to **move projects and people forward**.

Some people like to call that "_being **a force multiplier**_", which, be aware, is very different from being a _10x engineer_. In fact, a senior engineer is first of all a **team player** and not a lone hero, or a rockstar, a superstar, a magician, a grey-bearded wizard, a unicorn, or a [_whatchamaccalit_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/whatchamacallit)!

Easier said than done! What kind of skills, mindset, and duties are we talking about? How can an engineer effectively help to move things forward (more than a junior or a mid-level engineer can do)?

## Am I a senior yet?

The first myth to bust is that being senior is not necessarily a matter of how long one has been in the market!

> More time ≠ more senior

Yes, it definitely helps to have been around for longer. The more you do something the higher the chances that you will have faced different challenges and learned something from them!

But let's not say that you are a senior if you have _5+ years of experience_ or something like that. Unfortunately, this simple model won't work well for many engineers!

Similarly, being a senior is not a matter of age. Growing older doesn't necessarily make you better at your job... a senior is not someone with _at least 40 years of age_...

In my career, I had the fortune to truly appreciate this.

I had some very young but extremely passionate and skilled colleagues that I would definitely consider senior, and I also had _older_ colleagues with many years in the industry on their CV but their contribution to the team and the project was nearly close to zero, if not even negative! I wouldn't have called them senior, even though, most of the time, the company recognised them as such...


![A hand coming from a hole handing an old-style alarm clock](./a-hand-with-an-alarm-clock.jpg)

## What skills do I need?

If it's not a matter of time in the industry, what is it then?

Remember, it's all about moving your project and your team forward... and this takes some skills, so what kind of skills are we talking about?!

When it comes to **technical skills**, a senior software engineer is expected to have a solid foundation in programming languages, frameworks, databases, architectures, etc. However, technical skills are not the only thing that sets a senior software engineer apart. **Soft skills**, such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving, are equally important.

I would even argue that **for a senior engineer, soft skills are even more important than technical skills**, because it's not just about what you know, but is about how you communicate that, how you influence other people to leverage your knowledge, how you share your expertise, unblock tricky situations, and make the team more self-sufficient and productive.

Communication skills are vital for senior software engineers, as they often work with cross-functional teams and communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. A senior engineer must be able to clearly articulate their ideas, listen actively, and provide constructive feedback.

Leadership skills are also essential for senior software engineers, as they are often responsible for mentoring junior team members, leading project teams, and making hard technical decisions. A senior engineer must be able to inspire and motivate their team, delegate tasks effectively, and provide guidance and support when needed.

Problem-solving skills are another critical skill set that senior software engineers must possess. They must be able to think critically, analyze complex problems, and find creative solutions. Senior engineers should be comfortable with ambiguity and be able to adapt quickly to changing requirements.

At the end of the day, software engineering is all about solving problems!

But in complex organisations, with many stakeholders coming from very different backgrounds, problems are not only technical. And problems can be badly defined and change often. So, being able to contribute to understanding what is the problem at hand, creating and sharing a vision, steering the team to take the right direction are all crucial skills that can have a massive impact.

The best _technical_ solution is not always the absolute best solution for an organisation.

The best solution is one that accounts for how easy it is for more junior people to contribute to it, how easy it will be to evolve it and adapt it to changing requirements, how well will it scale if the business is successful, etc. 

Sometimes you might have to compromise on purely technical qualities to come up with solutions that are optimal for the team and the business environment you are working on.

It takes a lot more than just technical skills to see all the facets of a project and be able to come up with solutions that can fulfill all the needs.

## Am I technical enough?

Ok, ok... but I know we should really talk more about pure technical expertise!

After all, given the way the tech industry works today, this is the first thing people will recognize you for!

If you cannot demonstrate technical expertise you are not even going to have a chance at getting a spot for that job position you really like!


### T-shaped profile

As a senior software engineer, possessing technical skills that span across different domains is crucial to thriving in the ever-evolving landscape of software development. To be an effective and efficient senior software engineer, a **T-shaped profile** that emphasizes mastery of one skill and proficiency in others is essential.

![A road sign with a T representing the idea of a T-shaped profile](./t-shaped-profile.jpg)

<small>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@farber?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Jonathan Farber</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/t?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></small>

A T-shaped profile for a software engineer refers to having expertise in a specific skill or domain (represented by the vertical stroke of the T), while also having a broad understanding of other areas (represented by the horizontal stroke). This allows individuals to contribute to a project in multiple ways while still being an expert in their primary area of focus. T-shaped profiles enable effective collaboration with team members who have different skill sets, leading to a more successful development process.

A good way to build a T-shaped profile is to start by developing your vertical stroke: what will eventually become your core strength!

Focus for a while on one area only. Yes, it's better if you pick one that you really like.

When you feel you mastered that particular domain try to expand your knowledge around it and start developing your horizontal stroke. Step outside your comfort zone and explore related topics. Ideally, these related topics should compound your existing knowledge and extend your ability to build products end-to-end.

If you have become an expert in API development, you might want to explore databases or frontend development, because those will start to move you to a more "full-stack" profile. Similarly, you could also explore infrastructure-as-code and learn how to bring applications to production.

The trick is not to try to become an expert in every one of these additional areas, but just to learn enough to be able to understand the basic ideas and collaborate effectively with people who have these areas of knowledge as their core expertise.


### Broad understanding

A broad understanding of software development is also necessary. This includes understanding the platform, architecture, code structure, testing, deployment processes, and scalability models.

Moreover, a senior software engineer should comprehend the tradeoffs between different technologies and paradigms such as Monolith vs Microservices, Memory vs CPU, Highly Scalable vs Low Latency, Reusable vs Bespoke, and Complex vs Simple. Understanding the short and long-term impact of these tradeoffs is also crucial.

Developing this kind of knowledge is non-trivial. It certainly requires spending a significant amount of time building products and doing so adopting different practices, programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, etc.

You can broaden your knowledge only if you appreciate that every technical choice comes with its own set of tradeoffs. There will always be positive aspects and negative ones.

**There's no silver bullet in technology!**

There's no framework that you can use to build any kind of application optimally!

If you have a comprehensive enough understanding of the tech landscape, you should be able to tell which set of technologies is the best to address the specific problem at hand.

And, of course, it's ok to be proven wrong, as long as you keep an open mind and you leave yourself (and the team) room for making mistakes, learning from failures, and trying alternative approaches.

The path to success is rarely a straight line...

![A contorted mountain road representing an ideal path to success](./the-path-to-success-is-not-a-straight-line.jpg)

<small>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sylvaingllm?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Sylvain Gllm</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/X4dBqRUzO2U?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></small>


### Gonna cath all bugs!

We know that bug-free software is a myth, so I am not going to say that a senior software engineer doesn't create bugs! Of course, they do...

But it's really important for a senior software engineer to know what can be done to reduce the number of bugs to the very minimum and to try to spot them as early as possible (possibly before the users do).

Understanding and refining user stories, writing different types of tests such as unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, finding and discussing edge cases, and keeping track of technical debt are all essential skills.

A senior software engineer should be able to make a big difference here and help the entire team to write better softaware by introducing and educating best practices about software testing.

I would argue that it's not too hard to write tests, but writing good tests it's almost an art!

To write effective tests, you need to write testable code. This means designing code that's modular, loosely coupled, and has well-defined inputs and outputs. The better the code is designed, the easier it is to write tests for it.

Your tests should be easy to read, understand, and maintain. Use descriptive names for your tests, and write tests that cover one specific feature or behavior. Avoid testing multiple features in the same test, as it can make it harder to pinpoint the source of the error.

But how to learn to do all of this?!

Again, practice practice practice!

Start by accepting that untested code is bad code (or to the very least code that should keep you awake at night), then try to understand the specific business domain and what makes sense to be tested and how: what kind of inputs are the most representative, what kind of outputs are expected and what kind of side effects can happen.

Learn the different types of tests and different testing frameworks. Finally, learn which types of test will provide the most value for the business and optimise the team workflow to focus more on those.

### Promote the right patterns

Having written [a book on design patterns](https://nodejsdesignpatterns.com/) I am certainly biased on this one...

A senior software engineer should have developed some degree of _flexibility_ in different programming languages and paradigms such as OOP vs Functional, Declarative vs Imperative, and Compiled vs Interpreted is also a vital skill. This will allow a senior software engineer to be able to solve the same problem using different tools and techniques.

Similarly, a senior software engineer should understand various design patterns and best practices. This will allow them to suggest patterns that can have good long-term effects, and avoid patterns that will eventually lead to problems.

Code is something that will need to evolve as the business and customer needs change, so it is important to design with evolution in mind.

Patterns are not silver bullets, but just blueprints that you can decide to use to address common situations and pave the way for future improvements.

Don't try to be dogmatic and apply specific design patterns _just because you can_, try to think about what's the value that the specific pattern is bringing to the project and whether that value is actually important.

Sometimes, _simple dummy code_ can be very effective and it can be understood and evolved easily. Some other times you do need the structure imposed by specific design patterns because that might able to make your code more testable, extendable, configurable, etc.

As a senior software engineer, this is an opportunity to shine and have a significant impact during pairing sessions and code reviews!


## What kind of soft skills?

Now that we covered which technical skills will give you an edge in your career and allow you to be recognised as a senior engineer, let's address the elephant in the room: soft skills.

You got that interview thanks to your hardcore technical skills, but now you have a chance to really make an impression by showcasing a range of soft skills.


### Growth mindset

The mindset of a senior software engineer is just as crucial as their technical and soft skills.

A senior engineer must have a **growth mindset**, a willingness to learn and adapt, and a drive for continuous improvement.

They should be **comfortable with failure**, see it as an opportunity to learn, and **be willing to take risks**.

Always remember a senior engineer must also be a team player, not a hero. They should collaborate with their team, support their colleagues, and contribute to the team's success.


### Being an active lever

A senior software engineer should have a very proactive role in an organisation. They shouldn't just isolate themselves in a room and keep smashing their fingers against the keyboard.

A senior should know when it's time to ask hard questions and take leadership to find what they don't know.

Being able to bring a strong technical perspective to a business conversation can be very impactful and inform the business on what's the best strategy to move things forward.

To all effects, a senior should become a bridge between product and technology.

This sometimes means that a senior should also **know when to say NO**. No to quick and dirty solutions (that will eventually backfire hard) just to hit a deadline. No to plans that only account for building features on top of features without considering user experience and the long term stability of the product. No to arbitrary technical choices just because "_we have always done it this way and it has been fine_".

Saying NO is easy, but also very hard. Everyone can just say NO, that's the easy part! What's difficoult is to argument the why of that NO, propose alternative point of views, find compromises and defuse short or long term time-bombs.

Being effective at this requires a fine degree of soft skills. You should know how to communicate effectively and pick your battle wisely. You cannot always say NO to everything or you'll become recognised as a grumpy _naysayer_.

It's more about being able to say _NO BUT_ rather than just a dry _NO_. And you should also be capable of doing that in front of the right people and at the right time...

When done successfully, this can have a massive positive impact on the business and the team. It can lead to innovation and create new business capabilities or unique competitive advantages.

This is definitely an area of growth for me personally. One of those things where when I look back at my career, I feel like I have failed at it many many times. But hopefully, I have learned something and over time I'll get better at it...

### Understanding the business

In order to be an active level in your organisation, you need to be able to understand the business as deeply as possible.

Do you know what's the purpose of the business? What's the long term vision? Is there a clear strategy? What are the unique strengths and what are the weaknesses?

If you can answer all these questions you are in a good position to use your technical skills to determine how technology can help the business to succeed.

Only with a solid understanding of the business you will be able to pick the right battles, focus on what matters and help design systems that can serve the business well today but also be adapted to future needs.


### Communication

> “Good communication is as stimulating as black coffee and just as hard to sleep after.”
> – Anne Morrow Lindbergh

As a software engineer, communication skills are crucial to your success. You must be able to communicate effectively with a variety of stakeholders, including other engineers, project managers, customers, and executives. This requires a wide range of communication skills, from speaking and listening to writing and presenting.

Since you will need to talk with all the stakeholders, you should learn how communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders in a way that is easy to understand. It also means being able to listen to feedback and incorporate it into your work. The ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders is essential for ensuring that everyone is on the same page and that projects are completed successfully.

Another important communication skill for a software engineer is the ability to explain uncertainties and propose ideas on how to address them. Software development is an inherently uncertain process, and there will always be unknowns and unforeseen challenges. As a software engineer, you need to be able to communicate these uncertainties to stakeholders in a way that is clear and concise. You also need to be able to propose ideas on how to address these uncertainties and move the project forward.

In addition, software engineers must be able to talk about failures and learnings. We already covered this, but it's important to remark that failure is an inevitable part of software development, and it is important to be transparent about failures and the lessons learned from them. This requires effective communication skills, including the ability to take ownership of mistakes and communicate them honestly to stakeholders. It also requires the ability to communicate the lessons learned from failures and incorporate them into future projects.

Communication skills are also essential for writing documentation and delivering presentations. Software engineers must be able to write clear documentation that explains how their solutions works and how they should be used and operated in production. They must also be able to deliver presentations that effectively communicate technical concepts to a non-technical audience. This requires strong writing and presentation skills, as well as the ability to simplify complex topics and make them digestible for the audience.

Good communication skills can open many doors and unblock complex situations. So make sure to practice them as much as possible!


### Supporting management

When you are a good communicator, you become someone who can be very effective at supporting various management activities, for instance planning, and driving ceremonies. You can help with keeping track of priorities and technical debt and split complex tasks into manageable parts.

You are in a unique position to understand and leverage team strengths and pull in the right people at the right time.

By working closely with management, you can ensure that your work aligns with the overall business objectives and that your team's efforts are being used effectively.

Planning is another crucial skill for a software engineer. This involves breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks, estimating the time required for each task, and prioritizing them. Effective planning helps to ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget.

Driving ceremonies such as stand-up meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives can provide an opportunity to share progress, identify issues, and plan for the future. As a software engineer, you need to help driving these ceremonies and ensure that they are productive and efficient.

I am not suggesting that senior software engineers should replace the role of project or product managers, but instead they should complement these roles and provide their unique technical perspective to keep objectives, plans and execution aligned with the expectations of the technical team.

![A kid holding a map as an analogy of a senior software engineer being able to support management](./a-kid-holding-a-map.jpg)

### Autonomy and focus on delivery

The last 2 soft skills I want to touch on are autonomy and a focus on delivery.

Sometimes senior software engineers are in a unique position to contribute significantly to projects that require in-depth research and grind. Heavily technical projects such as the ones related to performance optimization, significant refactoring, and re-architecturing. These are often projects that are quite important for the business because they can unblock innovation and bootstrap new business capabilities.

In my experience, it's not uncommon that in such projects, a single individual contributor might be well positioned to spend some amount of time focusing and achieving a significant amount of progress in a very short amount of time driving the first big chunk of the research forward.

But even in these situations it is important to avoid silos at all costs.

If you are working on such a project, make sure to have regular check-ins with management and other senior colleagues to keep your progress in check, get usuful feedback and share your learnings.

But the ability to deliver value by working autonomously is not only useful in research projects, it's a good skill to master in general.

In the software industry it is more common to work with things we don't know than it is to work we things we know!

There are always new domains to explore, new challenges to face and new tools to deal with. Therefore, it's important to be able to learn quickly and upskill fast when needed. You shouldn't be waiting for other people to teach you and tell you how to do certain things, you should be able to do certain amount of progress on your own, for instance by consuming and understanding documentation and existing code.

If you have broad skills already, it should almost be a second nature to be able to add more to it when needed.

Of course, it is OK to ask for help if you feel stuck, but it's also important to try to do everything you can to progress on your own so you can build as much context as possibile and maximise the outcome of the time spent receiving help from others.

Ideally, a senior software engineer doesn't need to much guidance. They are able to figure out what's needed to move things forward by themselves and by involving other people when needed.

Another facet of this involves negotiating expectations and understanding what it means to be successful in the current environment. It's good to be upfront with management and the rest of the technical team and define what individual and team success look like. If you don't know what's expected from you and the rest of the team, even if you feel you are doing the right thing, you might end up not delivering the value that is expected from you; similarly, you might not be able to help your team at being successfull.

Building this attitude of bluntness and clarity, generally keeps the mood more positive and helps with avoiding disappointments.

Of course, you can't always avoid all disappointments or failure scenarios. So when poop hits the fan, you might be tempted to blame someone else or the system, but it's instead more mature to ask what could have been done better and what could be done in the future to avoid similar issues from raising again.

![A fan with a red background](./a-fan-with-a-red-background.jpg)

## How can I grow?

If you're a software engineer looking to level up your skills and become a senior member of your team, you might be wondering what steps you can take to get there. Well, fear not! Here are 5 tips that I believe will help you on your journey.

### Go one level deeper

First off, don't just scratch the surface of technologies you're working with. Dive deeper and learn about the underlying layers.

You have probably built a website or an API, but did you ever wonder how does the HTTP protocol work? Or even how does the TCP protocol works and what happens in order to establish a connection? Understanding these details will give you a much richer understanding of the technologies you work with every day.

Yes, it's an endless rabbit hole if you start to dig... so how we we dive deeper without getting lost and get value from it?

My rule of thumb (which I have actually ~~stolen~~ learned from my friend [Roberto](https://twitter.com/gbinside)), is to dig only 1 level down in respect to the technologies you are already familiar with.

--- TODO FROM HERE!

But don't stop there! Learning can be fun, so why not create some side projects or utilities to test out your newfound knowledge? And when you're done, share your creations with your peers. Not only will this help solidify your understanding, but it'll also demonstrate your skills to others.

Another way to learn is by pairing up with others in your organization. Don't just focus on seniors - everyone has something to offer. Even if you're the one teaching, you'll likely learn something new in the process. And if you're not into pairing, there are other ways to collaborate, like code reviews or show-and-tell sessions.

But learning is only part of the equation. It's also important to have a positive attitude. When faced with a challenge, don't just throw up your hands and blame the system. Instead, propose solutions and facilitate conversations. And don't forget that compromise is often the key to success.

Creating content can also help you level up your skills. Writing articles or giving talks on a topic you're interested in can help you solidify your knowledge, while also improving your communication skills.

Finally, don't shy away from the hard work. Volunteering to tackle difficult tasks or messy parts of the codebase might not be the most glamorous job, but it's a great way to demonstrate your dedication and willingness to learn.

In short, if you want to become a senior software engineer, it's all about going deeper, having fun, collaborating with others, staying positive, creating content, and taking on challenges. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a true master of your craft!

Know when (and how) to say NO

They should be humble, open to feedback, and willing to share their knowledge and expertise.

Duties
The duties of a senior software engineer are varied and can vary from company to company. However, some common responsibilities of a senior engineer include:

Leading and mentoring junior team members
Making technical decisions and providing technical guidance
Collaborating with cross-functional teams
Contributing to code reviews and ensuring code quality
Communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Identifying areas for improvement and proposing solutions
Conclusion
In conclusion, the role of a senior software engineer is crucial in today's tech industry. Senior engineers must possess technical and soft skills, a growth mindset, and a team-oriented mindset. They should be willing to take risks, learn from failure, and contribute to their team's success. As the definition of seniority varies from company to company, it's essential for managers to set clear expectations and support their senior engineers' growth and development.




Senior software engineers play a crucial role in moving projects and teams forward. They are not just skilled programmers, but they also possess a range of soft skills that are essential for success in their role. In this article, we'll explore what's expected from a senior software engineer, their skills, mindset, and duties.

## Skills

Technical skills are important, but they are not enough to be a successful senior software engineer. Senior engineers have a "T-shaped profile," which means they have mastered one area of expertise but are proficient in several other areas. For example, a senior engineer may be an expert in backend and API development but can also do some frontend and understand cloud architectures.

Besides technical skills, senior engineers must have a broad understanding of the platform, architecture, code structure, testing, deployment process, and scalability model. They should also understand tradeoffs, such as monolith vs. microservices, memory vs. CPU, and highly scalable vs. low latency, and optimize for the most relevant ones. Senior engineers should also be flexible, comfortable with different programming languages, and paradigms, and can solve problems in different ways and with different tools.

Bug catching is another critical skill for senior software engineers. They should understand and refine user stories, write different types of tests, and find and discuss edge cases. Additionally, senior engineers should keep track of technical debt and help to pay it back. They should be good advisors, understanding patterns and best practices, and suggest patterns that have good long-term effects while avoiding others that may lead to problems.

## Mindset and Duties

Senior software engineers are team players, not heroes, rockstars, superstars, magicians, or unicorns. They are active levers that ask hard questions, take leadership to find what they don't know, and bridge between product and technology. They know when (and how) to say NO and understand the business, its purpose, long-term vision, strategy, unique strengths, main weaknesses, and how technology can help.

Senior engineers must also be excellent communicators, able to talk with all stakeholders, explain uncertainties, propose ideas on how to address them, talk about failures and learnings, write docs and deliver presentations, and make complex topics digestible. They should support management, plan, drive ceremonies, keep track of priorities and technical debt, split complex tasks into manageable parts, and understand and leverage team strengths.

Autonomy is another important mindset for senior software engineers. They can drive projects that require research and grind, but are aware of avoiding silos. They know how to get unstuck, ask for help, research and experiment, read the docs, and read and understand existing code. Senior engineers focus on delivery, negotiate expectations, and have a positive attitude. They don't blame the system, propose solutions, facilitate conversations, help find compromises, and have confidence that hard problems can be solved, even if they don't know how yet.

## Growth and Fun

To grow, senior software engineers should go one level deeper and not stop at the layer they are familiar with. They should build prototypes to test their understanding and learn new things, even if they are not directly related to their work. Senior engineers should have fun and showcase what they learned to their peers, applying their learnings at work. They should also create content such as articles, talks, videos, Twitter threads, etc., and make it a habit. Creating content improves communication skills and helps them become better senior engineers.

## Conclusion

Senior software engineers are essential to moving projects and teams forward. They possess a range of technical and soft skills, a growth mindset, and a
