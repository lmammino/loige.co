99% of our daily work is in lambdas. We have been working with them for almost 2 years. In that time we learned a lot and in this presentation we will share some of those learnings with you.We are going to focus on unexpected failures and how we recovered from them.

By discussing those failures, we will tackle topics like microservices hell, debugging, local development and some best practices.

Padraig has been working in IT for nearly 20 years, covering all areas from engineering, product development, testing, operations and senior management. He is the organiser of Serverless Dublin, Lean Coffee Dublin and Nodeschool Dublin. He is currently working on unicorndb.io (http://unicorndb.io/)

Luciano is a passionate fullstack software developer, Node.js and JavaScript believer and co-author of "Node.js design patterns" (Packt) (https://nodejsdesignpatterns.com (https://nodejsdesignpatterns.com/)). He Recently launched Fullstack Bulletin (http://fstack.link (http://fstack.link/)), a semi-automated weekly newsletter, completely open source and built on top of serverless services.

Padraig and Luciano are both working on serverlesslab.com (http://serverlesslab.com/), an ambitious project that aims to help companies embrace serverless.
