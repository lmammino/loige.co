Serverless is becoming the cool new kid on the block taking software development by storm. Enterprises and developers alike are embracing the new paradigm in order to drive innovation, time to marked and solve complex architectural challenges.

Join Christos and Luciano in this workshop as they take you through a discovery path and show you how to embrace the serverless architecture in your projects.

They want to help you understanding what serverless really is and why you should use it to power up your next ambitious application whether it’s running on Azure or AWS.

The workshop will involve a fair amount of code that you’ll need to implement to solve different real-world problems and thus at the end you should be familiar and comfortable with the serverless concepts.

### Topics

- Exploring the Serverless paradigm
- What are the typical use cases and the cloud providers you can use
- Taking AWS Lambda and Azure Functions for a spin with some entertaining examples
- Closing up with an advanced example showcased by the mentors

### Pre-requisites

- An existing subscription on AWS or Azure (ideally both)
- Familiarity with JavaScript/Node.js (nice to have)
- A laptop with Node.js installed >= 6.11 and a Bash (\*nix) /Command (Windows) terminal
- Azure Functions Core Tools CLI installed
- AWS CLI installed
