When I saw how dense the European Covid Greep Pass QR code is, I got immediately curious: "WOW, there must be a lot of interesting data in here". So, I started to dig deeper and I found that there's really a great wealth of interesting encoding and verification technologies being used in it! In this talk, I will share what I learned! We will go on a journey where we will explore Base54 encoding, COSE tokens, CBOR serialization, elliptic curve crypto, and much more! Finally, I will also show you how to write a decoder for Green Pass certificates in the most hyped language ever: Rust!
