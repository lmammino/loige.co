What is serverless and what is it good for? Is it really the silver bullet that every company should use or is it just another tool we should keep in our toolbox? In this talk we will bring an opinionated perspective in the world of serverless. We will tell some stories of success and failure and learn when serverless can be a great ally and when it's actually better to go with something else instead. Finally, we will explore some common gotchas and mistakes that generally occur when starting to use Serverless on AWS. By the end of this talk you should know if serverless can be the choice for your next project and how to avoid some of the most common pitfalls with it!
