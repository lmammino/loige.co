Planet9energy.com is a new electricity company that is building a sophisticated analytics and energy trading platform for the UK market.

Since the earliest days of the company we took the unconventional decision to go serverless and finally we are building the product on top of AWS Lambda and the Serverless framework using Node.js.

In this talk we will discuss why we took this radical decision, what are the pros and cons of this approach and what are the main issues we faced as a tech team in our design and development experience.

We will discuss how normal things like testing and deployment need to be re-thought to work on a serverless fashion but also the benefits of (almost) infinite auto-scalability and the piece of mind of not having to manage hundreds of servers.

Finally we will underline how Node.js seems to fit naturally in this scenario and how it makes developing serverless applications extremely convenient.
