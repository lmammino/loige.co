The landscape of module bundlers has evolved significantly since the days you would manually copy-paste your libraries to create a package for your frontend app.

Like many parts of the JS world, the evolution has happened somewhat haphazardly, and the pace of change can feel overwhelming.

Has Webpack ever felt like magic to you? How well do you understand what’s really going on under the hood?

In this talk, I will uncover the history of JS module bundlers and illustrate how they actually work.

Once we have the basics down, I will dive deeper into some of the more advanced topics, such as module caching and resolving cycling dependencies.

At the end of this session, you will have a much more profound understanding of what’s going on behind the scenes.
