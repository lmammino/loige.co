Let's shed some light on Node.js streams! With very practical examples we'll learn when and how to use streams in Node.js and in the Browser. At the end of this talk, you will be able to take full advantage from Streams and write elegant JavaScript applications that are much more memory efficient!

This talk has the ambition to shed some light on Node.js streams. It will provide very practical examples about when and how you should be using streams and it will progress into more in-depth stream topics. Don't worry, if you want to use Node.js streams in the browser, I'll have you covered as well! At the end of this talk you will be able to understand streams better and not fear them anymore!

In my experience with JavaScript/Node.js devs I find out that Streams is a topic still mostly unexplored and sometimes even feared. This is probably one of the most beautiful features of Node.js and it can be adopted also in the browser. Once you grasp the fundamentals, you'll be able to solve some ordinary programming challenges in a much more elegant and efficient way, so this is a very interesting topic. In this talk, I will cover the following topics:

- Streams: when and how
- Different types of streams
- Built-in and custom streams
- Composability
- Stream utils
- Streams in the browser
