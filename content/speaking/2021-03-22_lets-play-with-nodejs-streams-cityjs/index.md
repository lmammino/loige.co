It's time to shed some light on Node.js streams and have fun with them! Node.js streams are still mostly unexplored and sometimes even feared even though they are one of the most beautiful and foundational features of Node.js.

With very practical examples, in this workshop we'll learn when and how to use streams to solve some ordinary programming challenges in a much more elegant and efficient way. While doing that,

we will cover the following topics:

- Streams: when and how
- Different types of streams
- Built-in and custom streams
- Composability
- Stream utils
- Streams vs Async iterators

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to take full advantage from Streams and write elegant JavaScript applications that are fast and memory efficient!
