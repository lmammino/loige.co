In my experience with serverless architectures, I found out that middleware-oriented web frameworks are one of the missing building blocks in the serverless ecosystem, especially when building web APIs. Middy.js was born to fill this gap and allow Lambda developers to use the same mindset that is very common with more traditional web frameworks such as Express, Hapi or Fastify.
In this talk I will introduce why using middleware with Lambdas is convenient and give a very quick intro on Middy.js
