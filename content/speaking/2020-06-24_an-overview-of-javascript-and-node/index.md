In this talk, we will discuss JavaScript. Why does JavaScript exist in the first place? What is it useful for? How is it different from other mainstream languages like Java, C# or C? When you should consider using JavaScript (and when you shouldn't). We will also explore JavaScript server-side: Node.js and finally we will discuss when to use JavaScript + Node.js and when not to!
