## Abstract

Join AWS serverless hero Luciano Mammino as he gives you the practical details
to getting started with Rust in Lambda. Bite-sized functions are the perfect way
to learn about this blazing fast programming language that is taking the tech
industry by storm. Get ready as Luciano gets rusty and shares the how, what,
where, and why you should try it out yourself.
