## Abstract

You're already familiar with AWS Lambda and its potential for scalability and
cost savings. Now, imagine harnessing the performance and efficiency of the Rust
programming language to take your serverless functions to the next level. This
workshop is designed for developers who are comfortable with AWS and Lambda, but
want to explore the benefits of using Rust as their serverless runtime. With a
focus on practical implementation, we'll cover everything you need to know to
write efficient, scalable, and maintainable AWS Lambda functions in Rust.

## What You'll Learn

- Why the combination of Rust and AWS Lambda is a perfect match for optimized
  performance
- The tooling ecosystem, including the Rust runtime for Lambda and cargo lambda
  CLI utility
- How to bootstrap, test locally, compile, deploy, and remotely test your first
  Lambda function in Rust
- Best practices for handling different event types (HTTP, SQS, EventBridge,
  custom) and responses
- Integration with Infrastructure as Code tools like AWS SAM
- Dependency management, code organization, and testing strategies for Rust
  serverless applications

## Takeaways

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of how to
leverage Rust's performance benefits in your AWS Lambda functions. Whether
you're looking to reduce costs, improve response times, or simplify development
workflows, this session will provide you with the tools and expertise needed to
get started.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with AWS, Lambda, and basic knowledge of the Rust programming
language (ideally having read the official Rust book).
