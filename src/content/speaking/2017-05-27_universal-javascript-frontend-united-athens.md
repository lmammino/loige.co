Since we started to see JS on the server side, the dream of developers has been to reduce the gap and the cost of switch between frontend/backend.

Today with Node.js, React and a whole ecosystem of tools, this dream is becoming true!

In this talk, I am going to discuss Universal (a.k.a. Isomorphic) JavaScript and present some practical example regarding the major patterns related to routing, data retrieval and rendering.

I will use Node.js, React, Webpack, Babel and React Router and give you a series of example to get you started easily with this new technology trend.
