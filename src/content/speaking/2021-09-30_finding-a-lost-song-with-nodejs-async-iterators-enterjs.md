Did you ever get that feeling when a random song pops into your brain and you can’t get rid of it? Well, that happened to me recently and I couldn’t even remember the title of the damn song! In this talk, I want to share with you the story of how I was able to recover the details of the song by navigating some music-related APIs using JavaScript, Node.js and the magic of async iterators!
