In this talk we will take a trip into the world of iteration in JavaScript. If we would be talking only about `while`, `do while`, `for`, `Array.map`, `Array.forEach` and so on, this talk would be rather boring, so we will focus on the JavaScript iteration protocols and learn how to build our custom Async Iterators and generators!
