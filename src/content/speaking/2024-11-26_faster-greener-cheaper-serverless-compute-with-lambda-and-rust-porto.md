## Abstract

Rust is rapidly gaining popularity in software engineering as one of the most
loved and fastest-growing programming languages. But what happens when we bring
it into the serverless world? Although AWS Lambda doesn’t offer a managed
runtime for Rust, it is possible to write Lambda functions in Rust using a
custom runtime. In this talk, I'll share why you should consider doing so and
explore the advantages in terms of cost savings, performance, greener computing,
developer experience, and bug resilience.

You'll learn about the necessary tools and a straightforward approach to getting
started. We'll cover everything from local scaffolding and testing to
deployment, remote testing, and integrating with your favorite infrastructure as
code tools. Finally, we'll discuss benchmarks comparing Rust to other runtimes
to highlight its benefits.

Join us to uncover the full potential of Rust in serverless environments and see
how it can transform your AWS Lambda functions. Whether you’re looking to boost
performance, reduce costs, or improve your development workflow, this session
will provide you with the insights and tools you need to get started. Don’t miss
out on this opportunity to stay ahead of the curve and elevate your serverless
game!
