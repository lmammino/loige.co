In this talk we will revisit the iteration protocols offered by JavaScript (iterable, iterator, async iterable and async iterator). We will explore generators and async generators as well. We will use this opportunity to discuss some interesting applications of these patterns in Node.js and we will compare them with more traditional approaches like Event Emitters and Node.js Streams. Finally we will discuss some interesting integrations between traditional approaches and iterators and show some patterns and anti-patterns.
