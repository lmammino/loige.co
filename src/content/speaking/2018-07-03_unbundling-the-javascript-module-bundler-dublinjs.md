Today we all use Webpack (right?), but I remember a time when you had to manually copy-paste JavaScript files to create a package of libraries you could use in your frontend application.

Many years have passed since then and the landscape of module bundlers evolved significantly along with the evolution of JavaScript and Node.js.

In this talk, I will try to uncover some JavaScript module history and illustrate how a module bundler actually works, so that the next time you will use Webpack you will be able to understand what's going on behind the scenes.
