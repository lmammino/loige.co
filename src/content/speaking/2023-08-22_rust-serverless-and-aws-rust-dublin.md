Rust is taking the software engineering world by storm, but how does it affect serverless? In AWS it’s not even a supported runtime, so how can we even use it… and should we even try to do that? Spoiler: yes we should and it’s actually quite easy to get started with it! In this talk we will cover: What is Serverless and why it's cool, What is AWS Lambda, use cases and limitations, Lambda pricing model, Lambda and CPU allocation, Lambda execution model, Why using Rust with Lambda is a good idea, Cargo-Lambda and how to integrate it with SAM for Infrastructure as Code, Writing our first lambda, testing it locally and deploying it. In addition to all of this, we will deep dive on the Lambda interface and how we can fine tune the Lambda request and response types to our needs. By the end of this talk, you should be ready to write and deploy your first Lambda written in Rust!
