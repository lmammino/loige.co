A presentation by Luciano Mammino(@loige) about what it takes to be recognised as a Senior Software Engineer:

The goal of this slides deck is to:

- Discuss what is expected from a senior software engineer (skills, mindset, duties)
- Packed with opinions (my own and more)
- For devs to be inspired
- For managers to hire, set expectations, support, and evaluate
