Serverless is great for web applications and APIs, but this does not mean it cannot be used successfully for other use cases. In this talk, we will discuss a successful application of serverless in the field of High Performance Computing. Specifically we will discuss how Lambda, Fargate, Kinesis and other serverless technologies are being used to run sophisticated financial models at one of the major reinsurance companies in the World. We will learn about the architecture, the tradeoffs, some challenges and some unresolved pain points. Most importantly, we'll find out if serverless can be a great fit for HPC and if we can finally stop managing those boring EC2 instances!
