## Abstract

Using multiple AWS accounts is a best practice that can help you isolate and
manage business applications and data.

If you have looked at the AWS Well-Architected Framework you might have seen
that having multiple accounts for an organisation can help achieve operational
excellence, security, reliability, and even cost optimisation.

Starting with a good multi-account foundation is something that will enforce
many best practices from day 0, like, for example, not having long-lived
credentials on developers’ machines. And the benefits just get greater as the
company grows and the level of cloud adoption increases. It’s a practice that
scales well from 1 developer to thousands of developers!

In this talk, I will show you how to leverage services such as AWS IAM Identity
Center, AWS Organizations, and tools such as Granted and OrgFormation to manage
multiple accounts confidently and consistently.
