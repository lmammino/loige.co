## Abstract

Letâ€™s go on a journey through the world of multi-tenant architectures on AWS
using serverless technologies. In this talk, we will uncover the key aspects of
multi-tenancy, including security, tenant isolation, and performance. We will
learn how to utilise Cognito for authentication, DynamoDB to store millions of
tenant-partitioned records and lambda for compute.

We will also explore different deployment models and their tradeoffs, and,
finally, we will learn how to implement policy-based isolation with IAM to keep
our execution context tied to one specific tenant and avoid data leakage.

By the end of this talk, you will feel more confident building SaaS applications
on AWS with serverless technologies and you will have learned some of the many
insights that come from the AWS Well-Architected SaaS Lens.
