## Abstract

Rust is taking the software engineering world by storm, but how does it affect
serverless? In AWS it’s not even a supported runtime, so how can we even use it…
and should we even try to do that? Spoiler: yes we should and it’s actually
quite easy to get started with it… and the benefits are amazing!
