A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design. The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms.
Design patterns come in three different categories. Creational patterns include the generation of object instances. Structure refers to how an object is made and how things behave and interact
