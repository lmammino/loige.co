Luciano Mammino, Senior Architect and author of ‚ÄúNode.js Design Patterns,‚Äù joins
Luca Palmieri, Mainmatter‚Äôs Principal Engineering Consultant and author of ‚ÄúZero
to Production in Rust‚Äù, to discuss the powerful combination of Rust and
serverless computing. ü¶Ä

In their conversation, Luciano shares his experience transitioning from
high-level languages like JavaScript to Rust, focusing on serverless
environments in cloud-native development. They talk about the advantages Rust
brings in terms of performance and safety, particularly in AWS Lambda functions,
and discuss the challenges and rewards of adopting Rust in commercial projects.

Key topics include:

- The learning curve of Rust for high-level language developers
- Using Rust in serverless environments for cost and performance optimization
- Best practices and tools like Cargo Lambda for deploying Rust in AWS Lambda
- How Rust‚Äôs safety features give developers confidence in production
