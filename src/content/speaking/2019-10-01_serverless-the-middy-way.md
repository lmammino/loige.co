[Middy](https://middy.js.org) brings the middleware pattern into AWS Lambda making it easier to focus on business logic and to reuse boilerplate code across different functions.

In this workshop we will get started with Serverless and why something like Middy is needed to build
serverless applications. Then we will start to build out an application and leverage some Middy middlewares to make our life easier.
