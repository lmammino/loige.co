This June, I had an amazing experience talking again about Serverless and how we use it at [Planet 9 Energy](https://planet9energy.com/) at the recent [Shift Conference](http://shift.codeanywhere.com/index2017.html) in Split, Croatia.

In my talk titled "**Serverless: The pros and cons of building a company
without infrastructure**", I tried to address what Serverless is and why is becoming such a big thing, also exploring what I believe are the pros and cons of this new paradigm.

The experience was great and I was super happy to have a chance to share the stage with extraordinary people in the industry such as: [Chris Heilmann](https://twitter.com/codepo8), [Ike DeLorenzo](https://twitter.com/delorenzo), [Ryan Christiani](https://twitter.com/RChristiani), [Laura Carvajal](https://twitter.com/lc512k), [Aki Colovic](https://twitter.com/akicolovic), [Demir Selmanovic](https://twitter.com/mantrakbeg), [Christoph Reinartz](https://twitter.com/pistenprinz), [Dotan Simha](https://twitter.com/dotansimha) and many others!

I really recommend you to [watch their talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg1D4s1aLJVXMvYpBCh6_qA) and follow them on Twitter.

Also, I have to give a big "THANK YOU" to [Ivan Burazin](https://twitter.com/ivanburazin) for organising this event and for inviting me to talk.

## Video

If you missed my talk (or if you really want to hear my curious "_sicilian-english_" accent again! ðŸ˜…) you can check out the [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WunJFMfN2p8) of the talk, just published by the lovely folks at Shift. I have to say they made an amazing editing, I can almost feel like a professional:

## Twitter moment

I also created a [Twitter moment](https://twitter.com/i/moments/870877103423709184) to collect all my tweets related to this amazing conference.

I hope you will enjoy it:

## Closing notes

If you are interested in Serverless and you want to learn how to use it, you might be interested in booking a slot at [Skills Matter FullStack conference](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8264-fullstack-2017-the-conference-on-javascript-node-and-internet-of-things) that is going to be hosted in London from the 12th to the 14th of July.

There, I will host a workshop together with the amazing [Christos Matskas](https://twitter.com/ChristosMatskas) from Microsoft about adopting Serverless on AWS (Lambda) and Azure (Functions). It's going to be fun!

Until next time! ðŸ¤™
