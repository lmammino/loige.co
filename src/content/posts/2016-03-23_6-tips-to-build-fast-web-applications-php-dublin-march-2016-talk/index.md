Following one of my previous posts about [performance in web applications](http://loige.co/6-rules-of-thumb-to-build-blazing-fast-web-applications/), yesterday night I had the chance to give a related talk at the [Php Dublin user group](https://phpdublin.com/).

My talk was preceded by a great talk (and demo) by **Ricardo Melo** ([@rjsmelo](https://twitter.com/rjsmelo)) called [Docker and Php, a practical use case](http://www.slideshare.net/rjsmelo/docker-php-practical-use-case). If you are interested in the topic, be sure to check it out!

It was a great night, I learned a lot and I had a lot of fun, so thank you to everyone involved.

If you are interested in having a look at the slides, here they are:
